Sybil is a governance tool for discovering delegates. Sybil maps on-chain addresses to digital identities to maintain a list of delegates. This interface displays governance data for supported protocols, and also allows users to link social profiles with their Ethereum addresses. 

 Mainnet support only. 

## Social Verification

Sybil is a tool that connects wallet addresses to digital identities. Users sign messages with their Ethereum keys, and post signatures on their social profiles. Verifiers can then check these signatures and verify truthful address -> profile mappings. 

This interface allows users to connect their Ethereum addresses to social profiles using the Sybil verification flow. For more detailed documentation on the Sybil verification process, see here: [https://github.com/Uniswap/sybil-list](https://github.com/Uniswap/sybil-list)

#### Supported Social Platforms

This interface supports social verification through Twitter only. However, more platforms can be added in the future (Github, etc). 

## Governance 

The interface allows users to view data about delegates and proposals for multiple Ethereum governance. Users can also delegate votes and vote on active proposals. 

#### Supported protocols 

Currently Uniswap and Compound governance are supported in the interface. 

#### Adding protocol support 

Forks of Compound or Uniswap governance can easily be integrated into the interface. There are two data sources the interface uses: data directly pulled from Governance contracts and data from governance subgraphs. 

Steps to add new protocol support: 

1. Add relevant information to list of supported protocols in [reducer.js](./src/state/governance/reducer.ts)

2. Make sure to have a [subgraph](https://thegraph.com/) that can return data that matches the stuctures in [queries.js](./src/apollo/queries.js). See subgraph code for governance here: [https://github.com/protofire/compound-governance-subgraph](https://github.com/protofire/compound-governance-subgraph). This subgraph can easily be forked and pointed towards other governance systems. 

3. Add subgraph  client support by adding relevant information in [client.js](./src/apollo/client.js) and in hook `useSubgraphClient` in [hooks.ts](./src/state/governance/hooks.ts)

PR's for additional protocol support are welcome. 

## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Run

```bash
yarn start
```

### Configuring the environment (optional)

To have the interface default to a different network when a wallet is not connected:

1. Make a copy of `.env` named `.env.local`
2. Change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_ID` to `"{YOUR_NETWORK_ID}"`
3. Change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_URL` to e.g. `"https://{YOUR_NETWORK_ID}.infura.io/v3/{YOUR_INFURA_KEY}"` 

Note that the interface only works on mainnet to limit the amount of required data sources for governance systems.
